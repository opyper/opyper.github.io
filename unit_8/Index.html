					<h3 class="blogtitle"> Katherine Mansfield's baby meal: baked eggs with cheese straws </h3>
					<p> I came across this meal in Katherine Mansfield's journals (from 1919) and can vouch for the fact that it is very soothing and best eaten only with the company of a cat. I sat with Alfie(my version of Athanaeum) hiding from the storm outside and passed a pleasant afternoon consulting various cookbooks on the correct consistency of cheese straws and wondering why no one will give me a job.</p>

					<p>Hemingway seemed to live his life from meal to meal, and his novels are awash with references to food. Obviously one can't overlook the fact that his characters also seem to be constantly imbibing some form of neat spirit, so for this meal alcohol abounded. It flowed, was spilt, drenched itself into clothing and carpets and cats. And we didn't care. We were hedonistic bohemians living from fiesta to fiesta, flinging Pernod down our throats with reckless abandon...</p>
