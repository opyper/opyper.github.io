				<h2>About ></h2>
				<p> Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum Lorem.In 2015 I inherited over 200 cookery books from a friend of my grandmother’s, Dr Moya Tyson. Born in India in the 1920s, this was her lifetime’s collection and contains books spanning all the food developments, fashions and fads of nearly 90 years.</p>
				<p>Through this blog I want to explore her collection, pick out recipes and writers who have perhaps been forgotten and research the context of her books.</p>
