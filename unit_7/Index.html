						<h2 class="blogtitle"> Katherine Mansfield's baby meal: baked eggs with cheese straws </h2>
						<p> I came across this meal in Katherine Mansfield's journals (from 1919) and can vouch for the fact that it is very soothing and best eaten only with the company of a cat.
						I sat with Alfie(my version of Athanaeum) hiding from the storm outside and passed a pleasant afternoon consulting various cookbooks on the correct consistency of cheese straws and wondering why no one will give me a job. Follow your meal with a meditation on death, and a quickly jotted review of a Woolf novel and you're all set.</p>

						<h2 class="blogtitle">The end of the affair: falling in love over steak and onions</h2>
						<p>As Lent has just begun, and Valentines Day has just passed, I reached for the only book I know that deftly combines romance with Catholicism: Graham Greene's, The End of the Affair. In a moment laden with unspoken tension that begins their doomed affair, Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles tentatively acknowledge their feelings for one another over a plate of steak and onions in a Clapham restaurant. The rest, is history. Perhaps watching the Muppets beforehand didn't entirely create the right atmosphere for my meal, so I would advise perhaps settling down to the 1955 adaptation of the novel instead with your chosen affairee.</p>
